I'm Adrian, a cybersecurity enthusiast and penetration tester with a passion for uncovering vulnerabilities and securing digital assets. With a background in bug bounty hunting and a degree in Computer Science, I bring a keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence in the cybersecurity field. When I'm not diving into code, you can find me training for marathons and pushing my limits on the track.
